Here’s what the science says, Different mosquito species evolved to feed on different animals. And, probably within the last 10,000 years, multiple mosquito lineages independently evolved a predilection for people. As human settlements became more permanent, they provided plenty of standing water, even through intense dry seasons, which supported mosquito reproduction year-round.\nHow Mosquitoes Find Humans Male mosquitoes don’t seek blood they survive on plants nectar it’s the Female mosquitoes who seek blood for egg development, for mosquitoes eggs the vertebrate blood is very important. Over the last ~10,000 years, several mosquito species evolved to prefer humans What Attracts Mosquitoes? Before these close encounters happen, several factors alert mosquitoes to our presence:\nCarbon dioxide (CO₂): Female mosquitoes can detect the CO₂ humans exhale from about 10 meters away. Visual cues: Once they sense CO₂, they become especially interested in dark, high-contrast objects\nand the hues found in human skin. Body heat and odors: As they follow the CO₂ plume to its source, they eventually sense body heat and smells\ngenerated by microorganisms living on our skin. These microbes break down body secretions like sweat and sebum, producing organic compounds that vaporize into odors. Mosquitoes are especially attuned to these smells\nWhat Makes Some People More Attractive to Mosquitoes Temporary factors: there are temporary factors which can make a person more attractive for example Sweat can increase your chanse of getting bitten by a beauty strengthening you body odor. Similarly alcohol and pregnancy works the same way. malaria infection ( The Plasmodium parasite ) can increase attractiveness.\nLong-term factors: Differences in skin chemistry, especially higher levels of skin acids, attract mosquitoes. Genetics may influence skin microbe composition, affecting body odor. Studies show mosquitoes are similarly attracted to identical twins, hinting at a genetic role.\nAre you a mosquito magnet ? In addition to temporary factors, about 20% of people are thought to be naturally high attractors.\nWhy this happens seems tied to skin-specific characteristics: CO₂ and body heat signal general presence. But human body odor is more distinctive. Everyone has a unique mix of microbial communities on their skin, producing different body odors.Researchers found that mosquitoes’ receptors for acidic compounds are crucial in detecting humans. People with more abundant skin acids are consistently more attractive to mosquitoes.\nBecause this trait is persistent, genes may play a role, possibly by influencing the skin’s microbial composition. Studies show mosquitoes respond similarly to identical twins, but more variably to fraternal twins, supporting a genetic basis. so if you turn out to a mosquito magnet , i’m sorry\nNow you know if you are attractive or not "},"title":"Are You a Mosquito Magnet ?"},"/blog/can-you-change-your-skin-color/":{"data":{"":"","#":"\nA person’s skin color is primarily determined by the amount and type of melanin, a pigment produced by specialized cells called melanocytes in the skin.

Our fingertips and cheeks often turn pink when it’s cold due to a process called reactive vasodilation, which is part of how your body tries to maintain an appropriate temperature. This cycle of constriction and dilation continues as your body tries to balance keeping warm with protecting skin tissue from cold damage.\nInitial vasoconstriction: When you’re exposed to cold, your blood vessels constrict (narrow) to minimize heat loss. This is why your skin might look pale at first. Reactive vasodilation (hunting response): After a while, especially in extremities like fingers, toes, and cheeks, your body allows some blood to return to the surface in pulses. This is a protective mechanism to prevent frostbite by bringing oxygen and nutrients back to the tissue. Appearance of pink or red: The return of blood flow causes the skin to appear pink or flushed. In the cheeks, this is often more noticeable because the skin is thinner and has a rich blood supply. Why It Itches: Nerve stimulation: When blood flow returns rapidly to cold, constricted blood vessels, it can irritate the surrounding nerves. These nerves may misinterpret the signal and produce an itching sensation instead of just pain or warmth. Histamine release: Cold exposure followed by rewarming can cause the body to release histamines—a chemical involved in immune responses. Histamine can cause blood vessels to dilate and trigger itching, similar to an allergic reaction. Skin response to temperature change: The sudden change from cold to warm can make skin cells behave abnormally for a short time, leading to temporary inflammation or irritation. The itching you feel in your fingers or cheeks when they warm up after being cold is a result of reperfusion ( the return of blood to areas that had reduced circulation ) . This is especially noticeable in areas with lots of nerve endings (like fingertips) or thinner skin (like cheeks).\nIn more intense or chronic cases, this reaction can lead to chilblains (painful, itchy swellings on the skin due to poor circulation and cold exposure).\nDo you know ? The “Hunting Response” Also called the Lewis reaction,the cycle of vasoconstriction and vasodilation .It helps prevent frostbite by ensuring intermittent blood flow despite cold exposure.\nCold-Induced Urticaria This is a condition where exposure to cold triggers hives (itchy red welts). People with this condition can have allergic-like reactions just from holding something cold or stepping into cold air or water.\nChilblains (Pernio) These are painful, itchy, red or purple swellings when skin is exposed to cold and rewarms too quickly. its common on fingers, toes, nose, and ears.\nEskimo Nose and Ear Adaptation People from cold climates, tend to have shorter noses and ears, which are less prone to heat loss and frostbite—an example of Allen’s Rule, which says animals in colder climates tend to have shorter appendages.\nWarm Sensation in Extreme Cold (Paradoxical Warmth) In extreme cold exposure, people nearing hypothermia sometimes report feeling warm before they lose consciousness. This is due to the failure of the body’s thermoregulation\nCold Water Can Feel “Burning” At very low temperatures, the skin’s pain receptors interpret extreme cold as a burning sensation. That’s why frostbite can feel like a burn, and can resemble a thermal burn."},"title":"Cold Weather \u0026 Our Skin"},"/blog/does-the-sun-rise-in-the-east/":{"data":{"":"","#":"\n“As sure as the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.” it’s a phrase we’ve all heard as a symbol of certainty. But what if I told you this statement is only partly true, and in many places, not true at all? .While it’s broadly correct that the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west, this isn’t consistently the case across the globe. The direction of sunrise and sunset actually changes throughout the year and depends on where you are on Earth.\nWhy \u0026 How ? The key lies in Earth’s axial tilt. Our planet is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees, and this tilt is what gives us seasons. It also changes the angle at which we see the Sun rise and set. this tilt decides which hemisphere will face toward and away form the sun effecting the suns path and duration in the sky. these are the involved factors :\nEarth’s Rotation: Earth rotates on its axis from west to east (counterclockwise if viewed from above the North Pole). the Sun always rises in the eastern half of the sky and sets in the western half Earth’s Tilt and Orbit Earth is tilted 23.5° relative to its orbital plane (the ecliptic), and this is the key to seasonal changes: As Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the planet tilt toward or away from the Sun at different times of the year. This causes: Varying lengths of daylight (summer has longer days).Changing sunrise/sunset angles. Earth Orbits the Sun : As Earth moves around the Sun during the year, the tilt causes the Sun to appear higher or lower in the sky, depending on the season and location. Directions The direction of sunrise (and sunset) shifts along the horizon over the course of the year. Here’s how Note In the Southern Hemisphere, the pattern is reversed:\nEquinoxes (around March 21 and September 23) Sun rises exactly due east.Sun sets exactly due west. Day and night are approximately equal in length. This happens because the tilt of Earth’s axis is sideways relative to the Sun — no hemisphere is tilted toward or away.\n☀️ Summer Solstice (around June 21 in Northern Hemisphere) Earth’s North Pole is tilted toward the Sun. Sun rises farthest to the northeast.This is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. The Sun follows its highest and longest path across the sky. The Sun is above the horizon for the longest period. It appears nearly overhead at noon if you’re near the Tropic of Cancer.\n❄️ Winter Solstice (around December 21 in Northern Hemisphere) Earth’s North Pole is tilted away from the Sun. Sun rises farthest to the southeast.This is the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. The Sun takes its shortest, lowest path across the sky. It rises in the southeast, sets in the southwest. It’s above the horizon for the shortest time. The Sun is low in the sky even at noon.\nThis Cycle Repeats Annually As Earth moves along its orbit, the angle of sunrise moves gradually from southeast → east → northeast → east → southeast again.\nRelation between sunrise and sunset Because of Earth’s tilted axis and orbit, both sunrise and sunset points move along the horizon through the seasons ,The Sun rises and sets on opposite points of the horizon. If it rises northeast, it will set northwest. If it rises southeast, it will set southwest.\nSo where does the sun rise ? Season Hemisphere Sun Rises Sun Sets Sun Path (Arc) Spring Equinox Both Hemispheres Due East Due West Medium-height arc (12 hrs) Summer Solstice Northern Hemisphere Northeast Northwest High arc, long days Southern Hemisphere Southeast Southwest Low arc, short days Autumn Equinox Both Hemispheres Due East Due West Medium arc (12 hrs) Winter Solstice Northern Hemisphere Southeast Southwest Low arc, short days Southern Hemisphere Northeast Northwest High arc, long days Explanation : The Sun’s arc is higher in your summer and lower in your winter. Earth’s tilt (23.5°) causes the Sun’s apparent path to shift. In June, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun → Sun rises northeast. In December, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun → Sun rises northeast there instead."},"title":"Does the sun rise in the east ?"},"/blog/human-history-and-skin-color/":{"data":{"":"","#":"\nA person’s skin color is primarily determined by the amount and type of melanin, a pigment produced by specialized cells called melanocytes in the skin .When ultraviolet (UV) sunlight hits our skin, people react differently based on their skin color, which is shaped by biology and evolution. The key factor is melanin, the pigment produced by skin cells called melanocytes. There are two forms of melanin: eumelanin (causing brown to black tones) and pheomelanin (causing reddish tones).\nEvolution We humans poped in the sunny savanas of africa where sunlight saturated the grounds, the sunlight mainly composed of Electromagnetic readiation and and other componets\nSun light 1. Electromagnetic Radiation (Primary Components) Sunlight spans a broad range of wavelengths, categorized as:\nA. Visible Light (38–49% of sunlight reaching Earth) B. Infrared (IR) Radiation (~52–55%) C. Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation (~7–10%) 2. Other Components (Minor but Significant) Radio Waves \u0026 Microwaves X-rays \u0026 Gamma Rays Solar Particles (Solar Wind) 3. What Happens When Sunlight Reaches Earth? Atmospheric Filtering: Ozone layer absorbs most UVC \u0026 some UVB Water vapor \u0026 CO₂ absorb some infrared.cattering (Rayleigh scattering) makes the sky appear blue. What Reaches the Surface ~50% visible light , ~45% infrared (heat) , ~5% UV (mostly UVA, little UVB) UV radiation triggers melanin production (tanning/darkening).\nMigration of humans The first humans, who evolved in Africa, had dark skin as a vital adaptation to protect against UV radiation. About 250,000 years ago, Homo sapiens emerged, with major migrations starting roughly 100,000 years later. Movement out of Africa happened in waves, with significant migrations beginning around 70,000 years ago. In Africa, darker skin with high eumelanin levels evolved as a protection against UV damage and skin cancer (melanoma). Melanin acted like a natural sunscreen, shielding cells from UV harm.\nDuring this time, a mutation in the KITLG gene appeared in populations moving into the Middle East, influencing melanin production and leading to lighter skin shades. This mutation spread with humans migrating into Europe, Asia, and the Americas, but it did not appear in groups that stayed in Sub-Saharan Africa or migrated south into Australia or Indian peninsula.\nLater, as humans moved farther north into areas with less sunlight, darker skin became a disadvantage because it blocked too much UV, hindering vitamin D production with the population spread to northern Europe and northeastern Asia, further mutations occurred (in SLC24A5, SLC45A2, MFSD12, OCA2, and MC1R genes), promoting lighter skin to better adapt to regions with less sunlight. Individuals with lighter skin, producing less melanin, absorbed more UV and produced more vitamin D, giving them a survival advantage in northern climates. .By 10,000 years ago, humans had populated nearly every part of the Earth. Skin color evolved mostly due to natural selection based on latitude and sunlight exposure, with darker skin near the equator and lighter skin closer to the poles."},"title":"Human History and Skin color"},"/blog/is-earth-flat/":{"data":{"":"","#":"Is Earth really flat. is everyone deceiving you \u0026 telling you that earth is round .you were taught at schools that the earth that we live in is round to be precise its a sphere. but your senses tell you a different story about our blue rock, as far as your eyes can see there is flat ground everywhere along with few bumps in the plane as mountains and platue. this poses a critical question in the mind.\nIs Earth Really Flat ? if not how can i know about it ( prove it ! )\nAre you alone in this quest. – NO –\nstudies and polls provide statistical data related to this theory in different regions.

Ship visibility: If you don’t believe in the government then you should believe in your brain and eyes, Lets observer what happens when a ship comes form the horizon .When ships approach from the horizon, you will see the mast ( top ) before the hull ( base ), its because the Earth’s surface is curved\n3. Lunar Eclipse: A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth comes directly between the Sun and the Moon, and Earth’s shadow falls on the Moon. This only occurs during a full moon.When the Earth’s shadow hits the Moon during a lunar eclipse, the shadow is always round—no matter where you are on Earth or how high the Moon is in the sky. - Only a sphere always casts a round shadow from every angle. - A flat disc (like a coin) would cast an oval, line, or distorted shape depending on the angle of the light. - Even Aristotle (around 350 BCE) cited lunar eclipses as one of his proofs that the Earth is round.\n4. Eratosthenes : Eratosthenes, a Greek mathematician, wanted to find out: “If Earth is round, how big is it?”\nHe knew that:\nAt noon on a specific day (the summer solstice), in the city of Syene (modern-day Aswan, Egypt), the Sun was directly overhead — you could even see the bottom of a deep well because the sunlight shone straight down. But on that same day and time in Alexandria, you couldn’t see the bottom of a similar well — the Sun was not directly overhead, and it cast a shadow. Two Possible Explanations: Flat Earth model: The Sun is small and close, so its light hits the Earth at different angles. Round Earth model: The Earth is curved, and the Sun is large and far away, so its light hits Earth in parallel rays — causing shadows to differ between cities. With just two cities, either explanation might seem to work. But… Add a Third City\nIf you add a third city, the flat Earth model can’t explain all the different shadow angles at the same time. But the round Earth model explains them all easily — the angles match perfectly with Earth being a sphere.

A Deep Dive into Myths, Facts, and Ethics Virginity has long been treated as a physical status, a cultural symbol, and even a marker of morality in many societies. But in a world increasingly guided by science and human rights, an important question arises: Can we actually prove someone’s virginity through medical or scientific testing?\nThe answer is clear and definitive: No. Virginity is a social and cultural concept, not a scientific condition.\nThe Myth of Virginity Testing Across various cultures, virginity—particularly female virginity—is associated with the presence of an “intact hymen.” This has led to harmful and discredited practices known as “virginity testing,” where a woman’s genitalia are inspected to determine if she has had vaginal intercourse.However, the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations, and numerous medical associations have condemned virginity testing as both medically invalid and a violation of human rights. Physicians and forensic experts agree: you cannot tell if a woman has had sex based on hymen appearance.\nWhy Hymen Checks Don’t Work The hymen is a thin membrane that varies widely between individuals:\nSome are born with little or no hymenal tissue. It can tear or stretch due to non-sexual activities like sports, tampon use, or injury. Many women do not bleed during first-time sex; others may bleed from non-sexual causes. Can Men’s Virginity Be Proven? Just like with women, there is no medical test to confirm whether a man has had sex. There are no physical changes, hormone shifts, or biological markers unique to sexual activity. The concept of male virginity is also cultural, not scientific.\nWhat Science Can Detect After Recent Sex While we cannot prove someone’s sexual history, certain forensic and medical tests can sometimes detect recent sexual activity, particularly within a narrow time frame (12–72 hours).Important: These tests only apply shortly after sex and are mainly used in legal investigations, such as sexual assault cases. They cannot determine virginity, consent, frequency, or partner identity without extensive forensic evidence.\nIn Females: Semen or sperm detection via vaginal swabs. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)—a semen protein—can be found in vaginal fluid. DNA analysis can confirm the presence of a male partner’s genetic material. Micro-tears or tissue trauma, though not definitive, may be observed. In Males: Vaginal cells or DNA on the penis or clothing (detected in forensic contexts). STIs may be evidence of past sexual contact (but not when or with whom). Semen analysis shows fertility, not sexual activity. ⚖️ Ethics and Consent Even when a person consents to a test for semen detection or forensic evidence, the purpose matters deeply: Legal/Medical reasons (e.g., rape kits) ethical and often life-saving. To prove virginity or “purity” unethical and harmful, even if voluntary, because it reinforces false medical ideas and social control over bodies.\nTakeaway\nScience tells us this: You cannot medically prove virginity—neither in women nor in men. Instead of trying to “test” someone’s past, we should focus on:Educating about consent, health, and respectful relationships. Ending stigma and myths around sexuality. Protecting individuals from harmful and invasive practices. Virginity is personal. It should never be policed or “proven” through someone else’s lens."},"title":"Is Virginity Real ?"},"/blog/what-is-nothing/":{"data":{"":"","#":"\nWell hello folks what are you doing ? I bet you were doing “nothing” just scrolling around randomly and accidentally stumbled upon this blog post, to tell you the truth i got this idea while i was doing ’nothing’. While doing nothing a question pop’s up in my head What is Nothing. Lucky for you we are going to investigate just that.\nWe often use the term “Nothing” in our day to day. In ordinary language, nothing is shorthand for: “No particular thing”, or “No action or event of significance.” This usage is context-dependent and subjective\n“What did you see?” - “Nothing.” (You likely mean you saw nothing noteworthy or didn’t notice anything.) or “Nothing happened.” (Something happened — time passed, you existed — but nothing of interest or concern occurred.) But Science Tells a different story\nScience Behind Nothing : When we say a box is “empty,” we often mean “there’s nothing in it.” But in reality, it’s full of air — mostly transparent molecules like nitrogen and oxygen. We perceive it as empty simply because our senses can’t detect the air visually. 🔑 Takeaway: What we call “nothing” often just reflects our sensory limitations, not the actual absence of substance.\nVacuum Chambers — Trying to Make “Nothing” Scientists create vacuums to remove air and other particles. Even the best lab vacuums still contain about 10 billion molecules per cubic meter. That’s much lower than normal air (~10²⁵ molecules/m³), but still not truly empty.The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN contains the best vacuum on Earth, even better than interplanetary space\nSpace Isn’t Empty Either when we think about void we think about space but the space itself is not empty either the Interplanetary space (space between planets) has ~10 million molecules/m³. Lets go further to Interstellar space (between stars): ~500,000 molecules/m³ buts its still no empty. Lets go even further to Intergalactic space (between galaxies): Even fewer maybe a few atoms per 10 cubic meters.\n🔑 Even at its emptiest, space is not “nothing.” It still contains stray particles, energy, and quantum activity.\nQuantum “Nothing” — The Seething Vacuum Even if its no possible lets strip out all the atom form a box in intergalactic space Even in a region with no atoms or molecules, quantum physics tells us it’s not truly empty. Space is filled with virtual particles: temporary particles that pop in and out of existence too fast to be measured.This phenomenon is called quantum vacuum fluctuations the vacuum is never truly empty.\nThere is never truly “nothing” in the absolute sense, no matter what we do\nWhat Does Philosophy Tells us About it. : Philosophy takes “nothing” more seriously and abstractly. But here’s the twist: to talk about “nothing,” we must think of it as a thing, which undermines the concept. even Aristotle: Rejected absolute nothingness. Believed potentiality exists even where there is no actual being.\nParmenides (5th century BCE):\nArgued that nothing does not and cannot exist. To speak of nothing is to give it being a contradiction. His conclusion: “Being is, and non-being is not.” This led to a school of thought that change and creation are illusions\nNow you Know About Nothing"},"title":"What is Nothing ?"},"/blog/what-is-the-hottest-thing-in-the-universe/":{"data":{"":"","#":"\nYou might have at least once wondered if you are the hottest thing in the universe or Do you consider your self to be hot and are in doubt that you might not be the hottest in the room for long. well i got you !. scientifically speaking we have a limit to how cold it can get Absolute 0 but we don’t have a limit to how hot it can get we can just feed energy and make a thing hotter and hotter, if things get any hotter then the Planck Temperature our laws of psychs began to break. so then …..\nHow Hot Can It Get ? Lets talk about you lets begain with the human body. Your internal temperature is 37 C, 98.6 F.Sure. But those are averages. Your body’s internal temperature fluctuates by about one degree Fahrenheit - half a degree Celsius - throughout the day in a cycle. But a dangerous fever is not good. 108 degrees (42 C ) Fahrenheit is almost always lethal.\nLets move further, to your planet The highest recorded air temperature across all of Earth has happened four times in Death Valley, where it has reached 129 degrees Fahrenheit ( 54 C ). 180 degrees Fahrenheit (99 C) is the recommended temperature for water when brewing coffee. 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1090 C ) is the temperature of lava fresh outta the ground. But come on. Make your own lava like Green Science Pro. By Using Fresnel lenses.\nWhat about your sun Right up on the surface of the Sun is a different story. The surface clocks in at 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit or about 5500 C ,but the centre, where fusion occurs, is ridiculous. Temperatures there reach 28 million degrees Fahrenheit, 15 million C. Speaking of which, the energy emitted by an object often tells us a lot about the temperature of that object. Any object over absolute zero emits some form of electromagnetic radiation. You and me, we don’t glow visibly, but we do emit infrared light. We can’t see it, but infrared cameras can.\nFun Fact : When matter reaches temperatures as high as those found in the center of the Sun, an enormous amount of energy is radiated away. If you were to heat only the head of a pin to the temperature of the center of the Sun, it would kill any person within 1,000 miles of it.\nWe can calculate the expected wavelength of radiation coming off of an object because of its temperature and that wavelength gets smaller and smaller the hotter and hotter the object gets. It goes from radio waves to microwaves up through infrared divisible, all the way to x-rays and gamma-rays, which are created in the middle of our Sun. At temperatures as hot as the Sun, matter exists in a fourth state. Not solid, not liquid, not gas but instead, a state where the electrons wander away from the nucle plasma.\nOur Sun isn’t even close to being the hottest thing in the universe. I mean, sure, 15 million Kelvin is pretty incredible, but the peak temperature reached during a thermonuclear explosion is 350 million Kelvin (349 million C), which hardly counts, because the temperature is achieved so briefly.\nLets Move Farther To Outer-space But inside the core of a star,8 times larger than our Sun,on the last day of its life, as it collapses in on itself,you would reach a temperature of 3 billion Kelvin. Or if you wanna be cool its 3 GigaKelvin. But let’s get hotter. At 1 TeraKelvin, things get weird. Remember that plasma we were talking about that the Sun is made of? Well, at 1 TeraKelvin, the electrons aren’t the only thing that wander away. The hedrons themselves, the protons and neutrons in the nucleus melt into quirks and gluons, making a hot pile of soup\nThere’s a star named WR104, about 8,000 light years away from us. Its mass is the equivalent of 25 of our Suns, and when it dies, when it collapses, its internal temperature will be so great that the energy emitted, the gamma radiation it flings out into space will be stronger than the entire amount of energy our Sun will ever create in its entire lifetime.\nLets move close to home Right here on earth in Switzerland, scientists have been able to smash protons into nuclei, resulting in temperatures much larger than 1 TeraKelvin. They’ve been able to reach the 2 to 13 ExaKelvin range. But we are okay, because those temperatures last for an incredibly brief moment and only involve a small number of particles.\nRemember how we could calculate the wavelength of the radiation emitted by an object based on its temperature? Well, if an object were to reach a temperature of 1.41 times 10 to the 32 Kelvin, the radiation it would admit would have a wavelength of 1.616 times 10 to the -26th nano meters, which is tiny. Like so tiny, it actually has a special name. It is the Planck distance, which according to quantum mechanics is the shortest distance possible in our universe.\nLimitations. Okay, well what if we added even more energy? Wouldn’t the wavelength get smaller? It’s supposed to, but yet it can’t. This is where we’ve got a problem. Above 1.41 times 10 to 32 Kelvin, the Planck temperature, our theories don’t work. The object would become hotter than temperature Theoretically, there is no limit to the amount of energy we could keep adding into the system. We just don’t know what would happen if it got hotter than the Planck temperature.\nClassically, you could argue that that much energy in one place would instantly cause a black hole to form. And a black hole formed from energy has a special name - a Kugelblitz. So basically, what I’m trying to say is when you want to tell someone you like that you think they are hot, so hot that not even science can understand it, just call them a Kugelblitz."},"title":"What is the hottest thing in the universe."},"/showcase/":{"data":{"":" Hyprland Xorg Custom Firefox 10 Fromulas Eon "},"title":"Showcase"}}
